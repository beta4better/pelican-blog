Pelican Sprint â€” Fall 2019
##########################

:date: 2019-10-18
:slug: sprint-2019-fall

In the spirit of Hacktoberfest, we will be conducting an informal sprint on Sunday, 20 October. One of the goals for this sprint is to migrate plugins from the current monolithic repository to individual, community-shared repositories. The following issues will provide some historical background for those who want to learn more:

https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/1488

https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/issues/425

Please `join us via IRC`_ this Sunday! Due to time differences, some folks will start earlier than others, so please be patient and stick around even if there isn't much activity there.

Looking forward to collaborating with you!
